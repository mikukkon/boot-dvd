README file for make_dvd.pl and cfg_menu.pl.

I got the original idea for these scripts from the article
http://www.linux.com/print.pl?sid=06/03/16/1724219, which referenced
now unavailable site/script at http://www.nautopia.net

I did secure the copy of the "script" by using archived copies of
the site, and while I liked the idea much, it consisted of distros
that had little interest for me. Also it required the lot of manual
work, as the main level "script" was just a wrapper for mkisofs(1).
	
So I first created a Perl script (Perl being my favourite scripting
language) to convert ISOLINUX (http://syslinux.zytor.com/iso.php)
isolinux.cfg files into GRUB (http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)
menu.lst files to help on this manual work. I named it cfg2menu.pl

After doing that, I noticed that the rest of the work was also
tedious, so I made another Perl scipt (make_dvd.pl) to do it for
me ;-)

Both scripts are far for beautiful or perfect, and especially
cfg2menu.pl will very likely break with some weird isolinux.cfg
files. See included iso.list configuration file for distributions
it have been tested with.
*** WARNING ***
Check the generated menu.lst files before burning your DVD!! 
Failure to do so may well result in wasted DVD-R disc!
*** WARNING ***

Feed '-h' to make_dvd.pl to get list of command line switches.
If you just wish to experiment, there are three switches that
can be used to skip phases:
	-b will skip the actual DVD-ISO creation, i.e. call
	   to mkisofs(1). Use this on first run, and check
	   the menu.lst files!
	-n will make the script ignore missing CD-ISO files,
	   i.e. the script will not attempt to download anything.
	   Reasons for use should be obvious. Note that once the
	   CD-ISO has been downloaded, the script will detect it
	   and skip the specific download.
	-u will skip the unpacking of CD-ISOs into DVD-root. Use
	   it after first run, as there is no point in re-unpacking
	   after the first time. Note that unpacking requires running
	   make_dvd.pl as root (NOTE!), and the script will detect
	   that and will not unpack anything if not run with root
	   priviledges. This is because 'mount -o loop' requires
	   root priviledges.

That's it for now, I will be happy to accept _useful_ patches to both
scripts; the license is GPLv2 obviously.
